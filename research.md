    <p>Following the completion of the fertility transition, the structural composition of marital status has remained relatively stable over the long term due to the counterbalancing effects of rising average age and increasing educational attainment on marital status. Using a conditional decomposition method and Monte Carlo simulations, this study estimates the impact of marital status on fertility changes. Based on microdata from four population censuses (1990–2020), the analysis reveals a gradually increasing contribution of marital status to fertility change, which is closely linked to the level of social development. This contribution follows a decreasing gradient from urban to rural areas and from more developed to less developed regions. Further analysis indicates the spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between social development factors and the contribution of marital status. The findings support the critical role of marriage in fertility changes and provide insights into the applicability of the second demographic transition theory in China. Therefore, a deeper understanding of China’s long-term low fertility trend requires further theoretical and empirical attention to shifts in marital attitudes and their influence on fertility behavior.</p>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has potential large-scale impacts on population dynamics. Yet, recent theories and empirical analyses fall short of fully articulating the extent and nature of the pandemic's influence on birth rates at the aggregate level. This study advances the comprehension of fertility dynamics amid the pandemic by focusing on the reproductive process. The effects of the pandemic on conceptions and pregnancy terminations may exhibit considerable variability, which, in turn, could dictate the observed patterns in birth rates during the pandemic. Employing the data from the Performance Monitoring Action survey in Burkina Faso and Kenya, which includes information on conceptions, pregnancy terminations, and births, the research dissects the nuances of fertility behavior in response to the pandemic. Findings indicate an uptick in conception rates around six months following the onset of the pandemic in Kenya, while pregnancy terminations did not significantly shift in either country. Further, the data reveal a pronounced increase in conception rates among disadvantaged groups, whereas a downturn in pregnancy terminations was noted predominantly in urban areas during the early phase of the pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of considering the reproductive process when studying fertility responses to catastrophic events.</p>

    <p>China's fertility transition process is characterized by a regionally progressive pattern. The process of fertility transition exhibits both temporal and spatial diffusion phenomena, with migrant flows serving as a crucial channel for fertility diffusion. Using data from the Life History Survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) 2014 and provincial fertility data, this paper examines the relationship between fertility environment changes resulting from inter-provincial migration and women's number of children ever born and reproductive behaviors. The analysis reveals that migration experiences from high-fertility regions to low-fertility regions reduce the lifetime number of children. Migration experiences in relatively low-fertility regions significantly decrease the probability of giving birth. This indicates that changes in the fertility environment serve as a critical pathway through which migration experiences shape reproductive behaviors. In the context of large-scale population migration from rural to urban areas and from central and western to eastern regions, this study provides a micro-level explanation for the diffusion phenomena observed in China's fertility level changes.</p>

    <p>The digital age has altered the methods of information acquisition and dissemination, rendering the frequent occurrence of rumors a common societal phenomenon. There is a lack of systematic discussion on the identification of rumors and their sociological implications in the digital era. This article, building on previous research, discusses the characteristics of rumors in the digital age and proposes a deep learning-based strategy for fake information identification. Taking the fake information about China and the Chinese community on Chinese-language Twitter during the pandemic as an example, we analyze the thematic distribution and dissemination process of the misinformation. We find that there is a division within the Chinese community, and that engagement in spreading rumors targeting China or the Chinese community is closely related to their attitudes towards China. This paper aims to combine the research paradigm of computational social science to offer insights for the sociological study of rumors in the digital age.</p>

    <p>Background: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with reduced human fecundity. However, the attributable burden has not been estimated for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the exposure–response function between PM2.5 and the infertility rate has been insufficiently studied. Objective: This study examined the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and human fecundity indicators, namely the expected time to pregnancy (TTP) and 12-month infertility rate (IR), and then estimated PM2.5-attributable burden of infertility in LMICs. Methods: We analyzed 164,593 eligible women from 100 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 49 LMICs between 1999 and 2021. We assessed PM2.5 exposures during the 12 months before a pregnancy attempt using the global satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates produced by Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG). First, we created a series of pseudo-populations with balanced covariates, given different levels of PM2.5 exposure, using a matching approach based on the generalized propensity score. For each pseudo-population, we used 2-stage generalized Gamma models to derive TTP or IR from the probability distribution of the questionnaire-based duration time for the pregnancy attempt before the interview. Second, we used spline regressions to generate nonlinear PM2.5 exposure–response functions for each of the two fecundity indicators. Finally, we applied the exposure–response functions to estimate number of infertile couples attributable to PM2.5 exposure in 118 LMICs. Results: Based on the Gamma models, each 10 µg/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure was associated with a TTP increase by 1.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: -2.3 %–6.0 %) and an IR increase by 2.3 % (95 %CI: 0.6 %–3.9 %). The nonlinear exposure–response function suggested a robust effect of an increased IR for high-concentration PM2.5 exposure (>75 µg/m3). Based on the PM2.5-IR function, across the 118 LMICs, the number of infertile couples attributable to PM2.5 exposure exceeding 35 µg/m3 (the first-stage interim target recommended by the World Health Organization global air quality guidelines) was 0.66 million (95 %CI: 0.061–1.43), accounting for 2.25 % (95 %CI: 0.20 %–4.84 %) of all couples affected by infertility. Among the 0.66 million, 66.5 % were within the top 10 % high-exposure infertile couples, mainly from South Asia, East Asia, and West Africa. Conclusion: PM2.5 contributes significantly to human infertility in places with high levels of air pollution. PM2.5-pollution control is imperative to protect human fecundity in LMICs.</p>

    <p>This study examines how China was covered and framed in global media reporting during the early stage of the coronavirus pandemic. Relying on a global multilingual COVID-19 online news narratives dataset, we propose multidimensional indicators to assess cross-country and cross-period variations in media discourses on China throughout the year of 2020. We derive and assess two hypotheses to explore factors accounting for the variations. The ideology-conflict hypothesis argues that the ideology distance from China determines the media attention and framing toward China in terms of COVID-19 reporting, while the crisis-mitigation hypothesis emphasizes that the domestic pandemic situation is associated with media discourses on China. Empirical analysis based on data compiled from various sources finds no evidence for the ideology-conflict hypothesis and moderate support for the crisis-mitigation hypothesis. Changes in the coronavirus situation and policy reactions are associated with changes in media coverage of China and the use of politicized terms over time. We conclude by discussing the implications of using online media data to understand the COVID-19 infodemic and its contribution to the emerging field of computational sociology.</p>

    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global surge in Sinophobia. We examine how Chinese language users responded to COVID-19 on Western social media by compiling a unique database (CNTweets) with over 25 million Chinese tweets mentioning any Chinese characters related to China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Chinese, and Asians from December 2019 to April 2021. Our analysis of Twitter users’ self-reported geographic information shows that most Chinese language users on Twitter originated from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. We then adopt the Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) and structural topic modeling to further analyze the sentiments, content, and topics of Chinese tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest that 61.8% of tweets in our database were contributed by only 1% of Twitter users and 62.2% of tweets were negative toward China. Despite the prevalence of anti-China sentiments, the target entity analysis shows that these negative sentiments were more likely to target the Chinese government and CCP than the Chinese people. Our findings also show that the most popular topics were politics (e.g., Hong Kong protests and Taiwan issues), COVID-19, and the United States (e.g., the US-China relations and domestic issues). Anti-China users focused relatively more on political issues such as democracy and freedom, while pro-China users mentioned cultural and economic topics more. Our social network analysis reveals that these pro-China and anti-China Twitter users lacked in-depth engagement in China-related conversations and were highly segregated from each other. We conclude by discussing our contributions to China and social media studies and possible policy implications.</p>

    <p>Due to global warming, an increased number of open fires is becoming a major contributor to PM2.5 pollution and thus a threat to public health. However, the burden of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 is unknown. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a co-occurrence of high baseline stillbirth rates and frequent firestorms, which may lead to a geographic disparity. Across 54 LMICs, we conducted a self-matched case-control study, making stillbirths comparable to the corresponding livebirths in terms of time-invariant characteristics (e.g., genetics) and duration of gestational exposure. We established a joint-exposure-response function (JERF) by simultaneously associating stillbirth with fire- and non-fire-sourced PM2.5 concentrations, which were estimated by fusing multi-source data, such as chemical transport model simulations and satellite observations. During 2000–2014, 35,590 pregnancies were selected from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys. In each mother, a case of stillbirth was compared to her livebirth(s) based on gestational exposure to fire-sourced PM2.5. We further applied the JERF to assess stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 in 136 non-Western countries. The disparity was evaluated using the Gini index. The risk of stillbirth increased by 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6–35.7%) per 10 μg/m3 increase in fire-sourced PM2.5. In 2014, referring to a minimum-risk exposure level of 10 μg/m3, total and fire-sourced PM2.5 contributed to 922,860 (95% CI: 578,451–1,183,720) and 49,951 (95% CI: 3,634–92,629) stillbirths, of which 10% were clustered within the 6.4% and 0.6% highest-exposure pregnancies, respectively. The Gini index of stillbirths attributable to fire-sourced PM2.5 was 0.65, much higher than for total PM2.5 (0.28). Protecting pregnant women against PM2.5 exposure during wildfires is critical to avoid stillbirths, as the burden of fire-associated stillbirths leads to a geographic disparity in maternal health.</p>

    <p>This article links media and social movement studies with world society theory to explain cross-national variations in media attention to domestic social protests. We compile a novel large-scale dataset with over 1.2 million protest-related news articles from 12,644 web news sites across 140 countries/areas in 2015–2020. Our cross-national analysis shows that both media- and country-level characteristics explain news coverage of domestic social protests. Our findings show that web news outlets with high web traffic and a propensity to report conflictual events tend to cover more protests. In addition, web news sites in nations with vibrant civil society organizations report more protest events. We also find that there is a positive relationship between online censorship and news coverage in general. But this is driven by news media in democratic countries, and news sites in authoritarian regimes experiencing strong censorship cover fewer protest events. Finally, news media in authoritarian nations with more organizational ties to the international community cover more domestic protests.</p>

    <p>BACKGROUND: Reducing domestic violence and increasing contraceptive use are two ways to improve women’s health in developing countries. Social scientists debate whether women’s experiences of intimate partner violence influence contraceptive use. The empirical evidence evaluating the relationship yields inconsistent results. These contradictory findings might be due to specific regional conditions that moderate the relationship. METHODS: Using 30 panels of DHS data from 17 developing countries, this study examines the relationship between intimate partner violence and contraceptive use in a cross-national comparison and assesses whether this relationship is moderated by macro contextual factors, including the presence or absence of legal regulations against domestic violence and the national level of female empowerment. RESULTS: Experience of either physical or sexual violence is associated with an increase in contraceptive use, and is statistically significant in a cross-national setting. The magnitude of the positive relationship between physical and sexual violence and contraceptive use decreases in the presence of legal regulations against domestic violence. The positive association of sexual violence with contraceptive use decreases in contexts with higher levels of women’s empowerment. However, there is no change in the positive association between physical violence and contraceptive use in contexts with higher levels of women’s empowerment. These results are robust to additional sensitivity tests. CONTRIBUTION: This study demonstrates how macro contexts moderate the relationship between intimate partner violence and contraceptive use. The results inform and reconcile previous findings by demonstrating that the positive relationship between women’s experience of violence by an intimate partner and contraceptive use can be attenuated when structural conditions change – namely, adoption of legal protections and improved women’s empowerment.</p>

    <p>Building upon how experiential learning theory explains sources of generalized trust, this study argues that discrimination experiences of others in individual's social network, especially those in close social ties, can have spillover influence on one's generalized trust. Empirically, this study focuses on family relations and examines whether another family member's discrimination experiences may shape an adult individual's generalized trust. Using husband–wife and parent–child linked data from the adult sample of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2012, this study confirms findings that an individual's discrimination experiences negatively impact their own level of generalized trust. Additionally, net of one's own experiences of discrimination, the disorder experienced by closely related others also affects generalized trust. This is true for effects that travel from husband to wife and wife to husband. However, these impacts are not found in parent–child relationships. The results of this study extend previous literature on sources of generalized trust by suggesting an additional mechanism whereby family members' experiences with discrimination spillover to affect generalized trust for closely related adults.</p>

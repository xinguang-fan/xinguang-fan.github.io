# About Me

I'm **Xinguang Fan**, Assistant Professor in the [Department of Sociology at Peking University](http://www.shehui.pku.edu.cn/) and a regional faculty affiliate at the [Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, University of Washington(UW)](https://csde.washington.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Sociology from UW in 2020 and an MPhil in Social Sciences from [HKUST](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/) in 2014, respectively. During the academic year 2023, I was a visiting scholar at the [Department of Sociology, UC Berkeley](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/), with the fellowship awarded by CSC.

My research interests include demography, social networks, family, and computational social science.

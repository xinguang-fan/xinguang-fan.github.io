# About Me

I'm **Xinguang Fan**, Assistant Professor in the [Department of Sociology at Peking University](http://www.shehui.pku.edu.cn/) and a regional faculty affiliate at the [Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, University of Washington(UW)](https://csde.washington.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Sociology from UW in 2020 and an MPhil in Social Sciences from [HKUST](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/) in 2014, respectively. During the academic year 2023, I was a visiting scholar at the [Department of Sociology, UC Berkeley](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/), with a scholarship awarded by the [Chinese Scholarship Council(CSC)](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com/).

My research is mainly in demography, social inequality, and computational social science. Much of my work adopts a network and dynamic approach by applying quantitative and computational methods. My work has been recognized by [IPUMS Global Health Research Awards(2020)](https://www.ipums.org/2020-award-winners), etc. My research has been supported by multiple funds, including the [National Social Science Fund of China](http://www.nopss.gov.cn/), the [Beijing Social Science Fund](https://www.bjsk.org.cn/), the PKU-Wuhan Institute for AI(PWIAI), etc.

I am currently working on three major projects. The first aims to comprehensively understand the driving forces of global fertility changes from a network and dynamic perspective. Building upon the fertility diffusion theory, [one study](https://rkyj.ruc.edu.cn/EN/Y2024/V48/I6/84) investigates how internal migration experiences influence individual fertility behaviors in China. It reveals a robust negative impact of living experiences in lower-fertility regions on fertility behaviors. [Another study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/padr.12626) introduces the reproductive process perspective to reconcile the conflicting findings on fertility responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the importance of the reproductive process perspective in understanding fertility dynamics amid disaster shocks. This project is supported by [National Social Science Fund of China](http://www.nopss.gov.cn/) and the [Beijing Social Science Fund](https://www.bjsk.org.cn/).

The second project investigates how beliefs, narratives, and information distortions circulate in digital environments. Using computational social science and quantitative methods, I study how misinformation spreads, what types of narratives gain traction, and how digital infrastructures and algorithmic logics influence public perception. This agenda combines large-scale textual data, social network modeling, and comparative media analysis to explain how certain types of content—such as rumors, biased reporting, or misinformation—circulate, are amplified, or contested across platforms. [One study](https://doi.org/10.1080/21620555.2022.2116308) examines how global media framed China during the early COVID-19 pandemic. [Another study](https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-01959-6) analyzes hostile narratives in Chinese-language Twitter communities during the pandemic. In ongoing work, I examine why misinformation often garners higher trust than verified information by focusing on social network structures and relational trust. This line of research integrates diffusion models and local trust heuristics to identify mechanisms of credibility formation within online communities.

My third line of research builds a task-centered approach to studying occupational dynamics in contemporary labor markets. Drawing on original online surveys and experiments, this project introduces the concept of the **life cycle of job task**, which refers to the dynamic trajectory of how individual tasks emerge, develop, evolve, and phase out across different stages of a worker’s career. This framework links micro-level task processes—such as initiation, evaluation, adaptation, and exit—to broader labor transitions. Adopting a demographic perspective on job tasks, this research further explores how changes in occupational structure and skill demand in China intersect with algorithmic management, workplace monitoring, and social networks. It aims to uncover how institutional sorting and algorithmic control contribute to new forms of labor-based inequality in the digital era.

# About Me

I'm **Xinguang Fan**, Assistant Professor in the [Department of Sociology at Peking University](http://www.shehui.pku.edu.cn/) and a regional faculty affiliate at the [Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, University of Washington(UW)](https://csde.washington.edu/). I obtained my PhD in Sociology from UW in 2020 and an MPhil in Social Sciences from [HKUST](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/) in 2014, respectively. During the academic year 2023, I was a visiting scholar at the [Department of Sociology, UC Berkeley](https://sociology.berkeley.edu/), with a fellowship awarded by CSC.

My research is mainly in demography, social inequality, and belief changes. By applying quantitative and computational methods, my work adopts a network and dynamic approach to understanding how population, social disparity, and belief evolve and the underlying forces shaping the process. My research topics include (1) the macro-, meso-, and micro-level mechanisms explaining population dynamics, focusing on internal migration and fertility trends in China. (2) attitude and belief changes from a dyadic/network perspective, focusing on information diffusion, perception bias, and preference formation. (3) the structural forces driving income and wealth disparity from a relational approach.
